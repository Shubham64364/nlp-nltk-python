### ðŸ“Œ Introduction
**Stemming** is a text normalization technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It reduces words to their base or root form, called the **stem**.  

The idea is simple:  
- Words like *"running"*, *"runs"*, and *"ran"* all refer to the same action.  
- Instead of treating them as different words, stemming maps them to a single root, e.g., **"run"**.  

This helps reduce redundancy in text analysis and improves efficiency when building models.

### âœ… Key Takeaways
- **Stemming** reduces words to their root form (e.g., *running â†’ run*).  
- The **Porter Stemmer** is one of the oldest and most popular stemming algorithms.  
- Itâ€™s fast and efficient but sometimes produces stems that arenâ€™t real words (e.g., *fairly â†’ fairli*).  
- Despite its rough edges, stemming is widely used in search engines, indexing, and NLP pipelines.

This script demonstrates how to stem both **individual words** and a **full sentence** using NLTKâ€™s `PorterStemmer`.
