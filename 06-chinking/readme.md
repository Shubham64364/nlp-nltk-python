# 06 - Chinking in NLP (NLTK)

This folder contains the Python script `06-chinking.py` and its output screenshot `06-chinking.PNG`.

## ðŸ”‘ What is Chinking?

- **Chunking** groups words (based on POS tags) into meaningful units like noun phrases.  
- **Chinking** is the opposite: it **removes specific POS tags** from chunks.  

ðŸ‘‰ For example, if chunking grabs everything in a sentence, chinking can remove verbs, prepositions, or determiners to leave behind only **nouns and adjectives**.

---

## ðŸ“– How It Works

1. A short sample paragraph (2â€“3 lines) is tokenized into words.  
2. Each word is **POS-tagged** (e.g., `NN` = noun, `VB` = verb).  
3. Using a grammar rule:
   - First, everything is chunked into a big `NP`.  
   - Then verbs (`VB.*`), prepositions (`IN`), determiners (`DT`), and `TO` are **chinked out**.  
4. The remaining chunks are displayed as a **tree diagram**.

## ðŸ“Š Example Behavior

For the sentence:  

`"The quick brown fox was jumping over the lazy dog."`

- **Before chinking:**  
  Everything belongs to one big noun phrase (NP).  

- **After chinking:**  
  - Removed: `was` (verb), `jumping` (verb), `over` (preposition), `the` (determiner).  
  - Remaining in chunk: `quick`, `brown`, `fox`, `lazy`, `dog`.  

This highlights the **core descriptive words** while filtering functional ones.

## ðŸ“š Why Chinking is Useful

- Refines chunks by **excluding irrelevant words**.  
- Makes it easier to focus on **nouns and adjectives** (key information).  
- Useful in:
  - Information extraction  
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
  - Text analysis tasks

- `\W` = anything but a letter  
- `.` = any character except new line  
- `\b` = space around whole words  
- `\.` = period (escaped)  

**Modifiers:**
- `{1,3}` = 1â€“3 repetitions  
- `+` = match 1 or more
