# NLP with NLTK in Python  
_A hands-on guide to Natural Language Processing using Python & NLTK_

---

## üöÄ Overview

This repository is designed as a comprehensive, executable walkthrough of core NLP concepts using Python‚Äôs **NLTK** library. It includes code examples, explanations, and sample outputs covering key NLP tasks such as tokenization, stopwords, stemming, lemmatization, corpora, WordNet exploration, feature extraction, sentiment analysis, and text classification with machine learning.

## ‚úÖ Who Should Visit / Use This Repo

This repository is especially useful for:

- **Students & learners** who are beginning with natural language processing and want structured, hands-on examples.
- **Data scientists / ML practitioners** who want quick reference implementations of common NLP tasks using NLTK.
- **Instructors / educators** who might use this as a template or teaching resource.
- Anyone who wants to **refresh their NLP fundamentals** or see how basic pipelines are constructed from scratch.

## üìå Key Concepts & Takeaways

These are the core lessons and functionalities this repo demonstrates:

- **Tokenization & segmentation**: How to split raw text into meaningful units (words, sentences).
- **Stopword filtering**: Removing common ‚Äúnoise‚Äù words that contribute little to meaning.
- **Stemming vs Lemmatization**: Reducing words to root / lemma forms and knowing when to use which.
- **POS tagging, chunking, chinking**: Understanding grammatical structure of sentences.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying real-world entities in text.
- **Corpora & WordNet exploration**: Using NLTK‚Äôs built-in corpora, lexicons, synonym/antonym networks.
- **Feature engineering for text**: Converting text into numerical features (e.g. bag-of-words, frequency distributions).
- **Text classification / supervised learning**: Building classification models for sentiment, spam, etc.
- **Model persistence & interoperability**: Saving models for reuse, integrating with scikit-learn.
- **Hands-on, example-driven approach**: Each concept is illustrated via runnable Python scripts and sample outputs ‚Äî not just theory.
