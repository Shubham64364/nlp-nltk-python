## üîÑ System Requirements
To run nlp-nltk-python effectively, ensure you have:

- Python 3.6 or later installed on your computer.
- Internet connection for downloading NLTK datasets and corpora.

You can download Python from the official website: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## üì• Download & Install
To download the application, please go to the [Download Page](https://github.com/Shubham64364/nlp-nltk-python/releases).

After you've downloaded and installed Python, you may need to set up some additional components for NLTK:

1. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**: 
   - For Windows, search for ‚Äúcmd‚Äù in the Start menu.
   - For MacOS, search for "Terminal" in Spotlight.

2. **Install NLTK Library**: Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

3. **Download NLTK Data**: Open a Python shell or script and run the following commands:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('popular')
   ```

This command will download the most commonly used datasets and resources.

## üìù How to Use
Once you have set up everything, you can start using the scripts. Follow the instructions in each script's documentation for specific tasks. Here are some examples:

- **Tokenization**: The script will guide you to separate text into words or sentences.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: This script will help you analyze the sentiments within the given text.

Each segment of the application is crafted to guide you step-by-step.
