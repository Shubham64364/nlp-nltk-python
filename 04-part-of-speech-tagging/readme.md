# Part of Speech Tagging with NLTK

In this example, we explore **Part of Speech (POS) Tagging** using the NLTK library.  
POS tagging means labeling each word in a text as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.  
This provides structure and context to plain text and is an important step in NLP.

## üîπ How it Works
1. We use **inaugural speeches** from the NLTK corpus:
   - `1789-Washington.txt` ‚Üí training text
   - `1793-Washington.txt` ‚Üí testing text  
2. The `PunktSentenceTokenizer` is trained on the first text to learn sentence structures.  
3. The second text is tokenized into words, and then each word is **tagged** with its part of speech using `nltk.pos_tag`.  
4. We print the first ~40 tagged words for demonstration.

## ‚ö° Why Train and Test Separately?
We train on one text (1789 speech) and test on another (1793 speech) to check how well the tokenizer and tagger **generalize**.  
If we used the same text for both, the model would be biased and results less meaningful.
